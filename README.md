# 📚 Business Understanding

## 📌 Background
From 2016 to 2017, there was a 4% increase in house sales, indicating a promising market trend. However, this growth has since stagnated, with the current sales rate remaining at 4%, far below the company’s target. This suggests inefficiencies in pricing strategies and a lack of focus on high-potential areas. To address this, we propose a data-driven approach to identify both high-performing and underperforming suburbs.

## 🌟 SMART Analysis
Specific: Increase home sales through marketing strategies that are more focused on potential areas and adjust prices for house that are still underperforming to attract the interest of home buyers.

Measurable:
Increased home sales percentage from 4% to 10%.

Achievable:
- Conduct market price analysis based on each suburb and find out factors that influence prices such as number of rooms, land area and location to identify areas with positive growth trends.
- Adjust prices for house areas with low sales to attract potential buyers.

Relevant:
By knowing the most potential areas and segments, you can focus your marketing resources and sales efforts more efficiently. In addition, we can also see which house areas are still lagging behind, so we can focus on increasing sales. The overall increase in sales will have a positive impact on your business reputation and profitability in the house market.

Time-bound:
The target for increasing sales is set to be achieved in the next six months.
